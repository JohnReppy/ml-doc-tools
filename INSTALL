PREREQUISITES
-------------

  sml
    The ML-Doc tools are written in SML and require SML/NJ version 110.99
    to compile (including the ML-Yacc, ML-Lex, and SML/NJ utility, HTML,
    and PP libraries).  It is also possible to build them using the MLton
    SML compiler.

  nsgmls or onsgmls
    The ML-Doc tools use nsgmls as a preprocessor and you must have it
    installed on your system. This program is part of James Clark's SP
    package, and is available from http://www.jclark.com/sp/index.htm.
    onsgmls is a new version of nsgmls and is part of the OpenJade
    project.
    On Mac OS X, you can install the opensp package from MacPorts to
    get the onsgmls program.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION
-------------

  Configuration is simple; just go to the root of the ML-Doc source
  tree and type

    ./configure

  By default, the ML-Doc tools are installed in ./bin, but this can be
  changed by specifying a different path using the --prefix option.
  For example

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

  will put the ML-Doc tools in /usr/local/bin.  Note, however, that the
  ML-Doc tools are actually just shell scripts that invoke the sml with
  the proper heap image.  The heap images are always installed in ./bin/.heap.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING
--------

  After running the configure script, one can compile the tools by running
  make in the root directory

    make build

  to install the tools, run

    make install

  After installation, you can remove unneeded files by running

    make clean
