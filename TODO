FEATURES
--------
	LONG table support for LaTeX

	We need to keep track of the directory structure of the ML-Doc files
	and reflect that in the generated files (e.g., ML-Doc/foo/bar.mldoc maps
	to Hardcopy/foo/bar.tex).  Also, we might want to consider creating
	the subdirectories in the output.

	Name substructures with qualified IDs (e.g., OS.IO).  The problem is
	that MLDocModule uses the qualified ID prefix to create the context
	and returns the unqualified substructure name.

	When we have a subtructure with a signature that is defined in another
	page, we should add a link to that other page from the comment
	section.  If there is no comment, then the link should go directly
	from the Interface section.  Note, we require a <SIGREF> tag
	on the signature for this to work.

	The <INCLSECT> tag is getting expanded into a misleading link
	(e.g., the POSIX_FLAGS signature is labeled as a structure).

	Fix HTML cross references for tables, figures, and sections.

	Need better support for floating tables and figures in HTML.
	Do we want floats on their own HTML page?

	EPS to JPEG conversion for figures.

	Prev/next links on footer.

	Citations (include URL field).

	Documentation.

	The grammar elements are not quite right, and also need to be
	supported by the tools.

	Some URLs have strings like
		large-int.html#SIG:INT_INF.\|@LT\|\|@LT\|:VAL:SPEC
	which is not valid HTML.

BUG FIXES
---------
	<SPECBREAK NEWLINE> is not producing a newline in LaTeX.

	The prettyprinter is not translating ID Family names.  I.e.,
	Int{N} should appear as Int<N>.

	Links to components that in substructures are broken (e.g., the
	list will be SIG:Windows.allAccess:VAL when the anchor is
	SIG:Windows.Key.allAccess:VAL).

	The mldoc.sty file needs some work to eliminate excess
	vertical whitespace.  Look, for example, at datatype
	specifications where the constructors have comments, but
	the type does not (e.g., Posix.FileSys.open_mode).
