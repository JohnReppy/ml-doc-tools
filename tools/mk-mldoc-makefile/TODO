Add support for non-flat source directories (e.g., ML-Doc/foo/bar.mldoc).
This will also require changes to the info tools, which store file names.

Use the configuration file to determine directory names, etc.

Generate the Makefile by editing an existing file (like makedepend does).

Add rules for generating dvi and postscript files (will need to get
latex.sh script fully hacked up).
