This library provides generic support for specifying configuration
options as name/value pairs in a configuration file.

The syntax of configuration files is simple.  Comments start with "#" and
run to the end of the line.  We have the following lexical elements:

	Name	::= {alpha}({alphanum}|"-"|"_")*
	Num	::= ("-")?{digit}+
	HexNum	::= ("-")?("0x"|"0X"){hexdigit}+
	String	::= <SML string literal>

Note that the syntax of string literals includes all of the SML escape
sequeces.  The configuration file grammar is:

	File	::= Def*
	Def	::= Name Value
	Value	::= Atom | Object | List
	Atom	::= Name | Num | HexNum | String
	Object	::= "{" Def* "}"
	List	::= "[" Value* "]"

Currently, there is one special name/value pair:

	"include"	String

causes the configuration file named by the string to be included.
