The basic scheme is to take a %INTERFACE element (STRUCTURE,
FUNCTOR, or SIGNATURE), and map it to a synopsis part and
signature plus description for each SIGBODY (SIGNATURE elements
have exactly one; STRUCTURE elements have at most one; and
FUNCTOR elements have at most two).

The basic layout is one

<title>
<synopsis>
INTERFACE-PART
<discussion>
<see also>

where INTERFACE-PART is empty, or

------------
<signature>
<description>
------------

or

------------
<functor argument signature>
<description>
------------
<functor result signature>
<description>
------------
