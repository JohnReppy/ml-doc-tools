I'm including a new version of mkdoc below as a shar file. The
changes include:

  - adding new options so that one doesn't have to append a 
signature file with dummy declarations to get SIGINSTANCE and
STRUCTURE elements. Basically, you can not specify 

    -s sname           to get <STRUCTURE STRID="sname">
    -i sname           to get <SIGINSTANCE> <ID>sname
    -f sname sid ssig  to get <FUNCTOR FCTID="sname"><ID>sid</ID><ID>ssig</ID>

Using + instead of - causes the matching to be opaque.

  - fixing some bugs that occurred when generating functors.
  - changing the option processing and usage reporting to reflect 
the new options.
  - cleaning up a few places in Dan's code.
