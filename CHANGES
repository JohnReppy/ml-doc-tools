Change history for ML-Doc tools
-------------------------------

[2022-07-25]
	Migrate the repository to GitHub.  Also updated the sources to require SML/NJ
	version 110.99+ and converted the README to Markdown.

[2012-01-01]
        Changed tools/lib/code-style/sml-token-scanner.sml to track removal of the
        option type in the REGEXP signature.  Also changed entities to translate DASH
        properly.  This version of ML-Doc requires SML/NJ version 110.72+ to compile.
        (Thanks to Alley Stoughton for these changes)

[2012-01-01]
	Cleanup source tree and move to svn repository.

[2007-06-18]
	Fixed a compile problem with the mkdoc tool.  This change means that
	ml-doc requires a more recent version of SML/NJ (110.61 or later
	should work).

[2007-05-11]
	Updated the mkdoc tool to work with more recent versions of SML/NJ (the visible
	compiler interface had changed).

[2007-05-11]
	Fixed various issues with supporting hierarchical directories of ml-doc sources.
	The tools now produce a directory structure under Info, HTML, and Hardcopy that
	is isomorphic to the ML-Doc directory structure.  I.e., an input file
	ML-Doc/foo/bar/baz.mldoc will map to HTML/foo/bar/baz.html.

[2007-05-10]
	The path to the nsgmls program is now set by the configuration script.

[2006-11-27]
	Change uses of Substring.all to Substring.full (the latter is no longer
	supported by SML/NJ).  Also updated the configuration scripts so the
	Intel Mac is supported.

[2005-08-30]
	Changes to extract-sig to track new TextIOPP interface.  ML-Doc now requires
	SML/NJ 110.55 to build.

[2005-08-30]
	Modified RunSGMLS to work around Tiger (MacOS X 10.4) pipe bug.

[2004-05-24]
	Bug fix for latex-gen.

[2004-05-21]
	Added filter-index tool.

[2004-05-19]
	The latex-gen tool now is smart about figuring if a <SECREF>
	refers to a section or chapter.  It assume that level 0
	sections are chapters.

[2004-05-17]
	Complete overhaul of how index entries are generated for the Identifier
	and Raises indexes.  Added support for KEY-VIEW elements.

[2004-05-13]
	Added MARK attribute to INDEX element (values are START and STOP)
	for specifying page ranges.

[2004-05-13]
	Fixed rendering of structure IDs to properly handle ID families.

[2004-05-04]
	Generated LaTeX now omits <QUESTION> elements by default (but there
	is a hook to enable this with a command-line option later).

[2004-04-29]
	Added \mldEG and \mldIE macros for &EG; and &IE;.

[2004-04-29]
	Added EQNARRAY element as alternative math environment.

[2004-01-15]
	Port to SML/NJ 110.43+.

[2003-08-26]
	Preliminary HTML support for <CODE> in <FLOAT>s.

[2003-07-31]
	We now generate raises index entries.

[2003-07-30]
	Fixed a problem with how NOLABEL sections were rendered and
	added support for <CODE> in <FLOAT> elements.

[2003-07-29]
	Added SUBINDEX element support for latex-gen and improved
	index generation (but there we still need to deal with
	index entries for specs!).

[2003-07-24]
	Added LaTeX formatting for Id families (i.e., "Int{N}" gets
	formatted as "Int\mldArg{N}").

[2003-07-24]
	Added <FLOOR>, <CEILING>, and <MOD> elements for math markup.

[2003-07-24]
	Added &IE; and &EG; entities.

[2003-07-22]
	Added a patch from Allen Stoughton that makes the generated
	makefile more precise.

[2003-07-22]
	Added <RE>, <REGEXP>, and <GRAM.ALT> elements to the DTD, with
	corresponding implementation support.

[2003-07-17]
	Bug fixes and added longtable support for latex-gen.

[2003-07-16]
	Fixed latex-gen tool to insert \pagebreak directives in the
	Synopsis, so that when the Synopsis is very long it does not
	force bad layout.

[2003-07-15]
	Added support for floating tables (<FLOAT><TABLE>) and added
	kind information to the labes in the info files.

[2003-07-14]
	Added partial implementation of INDEX element in latex-gen and
	implementation in html-gen (just ignore it for now).
	Also made ARG elements always render in italic-tt font.

[2003-07-02]
	Fixed pretty-printing of SPECBREAK elements to eliminate
	excess whitespace.  Also fixed a bug in the code stylizer
	with the handling of indentation.

[2003-07-01]
	Fixed indexing of symbolic identifiers, where the identifiers
	were comprised of special characters.

[2003-07-01]
	Got rid of old-style autoconf file and fixed a problem with
	ml-build for SML/NJ 110.0.7.

[2003-06-25]
	Added SMALL attribute to TABLE element and PARBOX attribute to
	COL element.

[2002-12-12]
	Ported configuration script to autoconf 2.50+.  It also works
	with onsgmls as the frontend.

[2002-07-16]
	Ported all of the tools except mkdoc to work with recent versions
	of SML/NJ (e.g., 110.41).  Also changed the configuration and
	build scheme to use GNU make and ml-build.

[2002-07-08]
	Fixed both html-gen and latex-gen to render comments on datatype
	constuctors.

[2002-07-08]
	Modified latex-gen tool so that <PROTOTY> elements that have two
	or more <PROTO> elements are followed by a line break.

[2002-07-08]
	Fixed latex-gen tool so that substructure comments are included in
	the description section.

[2002-06-17]
	Fixed latex-gen tool so that SEEALSO cross references now work
	(but only for signature, structure, and functor references).

[2002-06-10]
	Added URL element to DTD.

[2002-06-06]
	Removed the IDFAMILY element from the DTD.  Instead, we use the
	convention of "{N}" to index families of identifiers (this is
	rendered in HTML as an italic "<N>").

[2002-06-06]
	Added "OPTIONAL" annotation to optional components in the
	Synopsis section.

[2002-06-06]
	Added support for SECREF element in HTML generation.  This change
	also required changes to the index library.

[2002-06-06]
	Modified the tools so that there different Master info files
	for HTML and LaTeX output are used (HTML.info and LaTeX.info).

[2001-04-02]
	Modified DTD to allow <CODE> in <FLOAT>; also changed <TBLREF> to
	<FLOATREF>.

[2001-04-02]
	Rewrote extract-sig tool to use Spec pretty printer.

[2000-11-21]
	Modified the mkdoc tool to generate </ARG> terminator.

[2000-09-14]
	Added MTEXT element for escaping back into normal text mode
	from math.  This element replaces the CD, ARG, and %IDREF
	content in %MATHTEXT, but we still support ARG elements, because
	they are so common.  Note, however, that if two ARG elements
	are adjacent, then one should put them inside a MTEXT element.

[2000-09-11]
	Added raises component to value specifications (constructor VALspec)
	in MLSpec.

[2000-09-11]
	The mldoc-book.cls and mldoc.sty files now use the index package
	for indexing.  With this change, we can support an index of
	raised exceptions.

[2000-09-07]
	The mk-mldoc-makefile tool now supports different input file
	lists for the HTML and LaTeX versions of the document.
	In the list of input files, one can add the annotation "!html"
	(or "!tex) to exclude the file from being included in the
	HTML (or LaTeX) version of the document.  The annotation follows
	the file name and there must be whitespace between the filename
	and the annotation.

[2000-09-07]
	Added better error reporting to the HTMLContext module.

[2000-09-06]
	Added support for stylized text for CODE and CD elements in
	LaTeX output (HTML to come soon).  Use the LANG="SML" attribute
	in the CODE or CD element to enable stylized text.

[2000-09-02]
	Added NONUMBER and NOTOC attributes to SECTION element.

[2000-05-14]
	Fixed some bugs in HTML output; html-index now supports a template
	file.

[2000-05-18]
	Reorganized the presentation of functors in the latex-gen tool:
	now the argument interface and description are presented as a
	group, followed by the result interface and description.  This
	reorganization also required a change to the mldoc.sty.

[2000-05-18]
	Fixed bug in standard options that caused the configured path
	of nsgmls to be ignored.

[2000-05-17]
	Fixed bug in html-gen: functors with opaque result signatures
	were being rendered with ": instead of ":>".

[2000-05-17]
	Added a bunch of missing features to the latex-gen tool: signature
	instances, where types, and functors.

[2000-03-28]
	Modified how the BaseURL attribute is treated in HTML generation.  If
	one specifies the RelativeLinks flag in the configuration file, then
	intra-document links are generated relative to the containing file.
	If the RelativeLinks flag is not specified (and the BaseURL attribute is
	defined), then a <BASE> element is generated and the links are relative
	to the base.

[2000-03-28]
	Added anchors to specifications (these were lost when we switched to
	the specification pretty-printer).

[2000-03-28]
	Added -root option to mk-mldoc-makefile.  This option allows one to
	specify the document root for the Hardcopy target.  The argument should
	not have the ".tex" suffix.

[2000-03-25]
	Fixed bug in HTMLPPSpec that caused links to be output as anchors (also
	simplified the representation of tokens).

[2000-03-24]
	Added BASE and META elements to document head in html-gen.

[2000-03-24]
	Fixed various pretty-printing problems (sharing constraints, substructures,
	and datatypes).

[2000-03-24]
	Fixed html-gen tool to not generate null descriptions.

[2000-03-23]
	Further changes to mk-mldoc-makefile and the other tools to better
	support subdirectories.  It is now necessary for the output directories
	to have the same directory structure as the ML-Doc directory tree.

[2000-03-23]
	Minor fixes to the output of the mkdoc tool.

[2000-02-11]
	Modified the mk-mldoc-makefile tool to handle subdirectories in
	the ML-Doc sources.  Note that this structure is not preserved
	in the generated file directories.

[2000-02-11]
	Modified the mk-mldoc-makefile tool to accept an input list from
	standard input.  One can now do something like

		find ML-Doc -name "*.mldoc" -print | mk-mldoc-input

	to generate the makefile.

[2000-02-02]
	Added SPECBREAK element, which can be used to introduce whitespace
	and pagebreaks into long interfaces.

[2000-02-02]
	Added ID.INDEX as content of IDFAMILY.  The idea is that we use
	<IDFAMILY>Int<ID.INDEX NAME="N"></IDFAMILY> as markup for the
	family of IntN structures.

[2000-01-27]
	Fixed tableToHTML in tools/lib/html/text-to-html.sml so that cells
	that span more than one column are handled properly.

[2000-01-17]
	Added an autoconf-based configuration script and Makefile for building
	and installing the tools.  This will allow users to install without
	hand-editing sources or scripts.

[1999-05-05]
	Fixed a PP Library bug where nesting of relative and absolute indentation
	did not work.  Also fixed bug in HTML generation, where sdata wasn't
	getting translated in specifications.

[1999-04-28]
	Changes to support the latest version of the DTD.  Also added a
	pretty-printer for spcifications.  The PP code needs a lot of tuning/
	debugging before the layout will be acceptable, and currently links
	are not being properly generated.

[1999-04-12]
	A number of changes to the DTD to better support production of the
	book.  Mostly related to indexing.

[1998-07-21]
	Patched mkdoc to generate <SPEC> tags before <SHARING> tags (this
	was a change in the DTD that mkdoc did not track).

[1998-07-13]
	Added first version of latex-gen tool (written by Andrew Appel).

[1998-06-19]
	New version of mkdoc (thanks to Emden Gansner).  Changes include:
	  - new options for specifying the name of the structure/signature
	    instance/functor that you want.
	  - bug fixes and code cleanup.

[1998-06-19]
	Fixed a bug in html-index tool: it wasn't handling items declared
	in anonymous functor result signatures.

[1998-06-19]
	Added support to the info format and database to handle signatures
	that are defined in other documents.

[1998-06-16]
	Changed the DTD to allow a <SIGREF> element as the signature
	of a functor argument.  This also required changes to the
	various tools.

[1998-06-16]
	Fixed a bug with the lookup of the path for nsgmls (the "Tools"
	link was missing).

[1998-05-12]
	Added a feature to the mkdoc tool to incorporate the comments from
	the SML signature file as comments in the ML-Doc file.  Thanks to
	Dan Wang (danwang@cs.princeton.edu).

[1998-05-07]
	Added new targets to generated makefiles: clean-info, clean-proof,
	and clean-html.

[1998-05-07]
	Fixed a bug in mk-mldoc-makefile:  change "$(ProofFiles)"
	to "$(PROOF_FILES)".

[1998-05-06]
	Added HTML template support to html-index and html-toc.  Also
	added additional entities for refering to the current date
	in templates.

[1998-05-05]
	Added html-toc tool; this required modifications to the html-gen
	tool to include anchors on sections, and to mk-mldoc-makefile.

[1998-04-27]
	Added missing <ID> tag after <INCLUDE> in mkdoc output.

[1998-04-25]
	Fixed tools/make.sh script to check for subdirectories and
	to not require "." in PATH.

[1998-04-24]
	First alpha release.
